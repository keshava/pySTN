# pySTN
Implementation of a robust scheduling system based on STN (State-Task-Network) models.

## Description
This is supporting code to reproduce the results in [Citation].
It allows the construction of a schedule optimizer according to the model in [1], and it also
implements a robustification procedure that renders the schedules immune to uncertain events such as
unit or tasks delays an swaps.

## Usage
Please refer to this (./STN with Python.ipynb)[IPython notebook].
